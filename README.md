# motifFinding_challenges

These scripts mostly take DNA sequences to  find motifs, which are a nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern that is widespread in the genome. There are also scripts to calculate the distance (Segregating sites), which is also part of the motif finding process.

The project is separated by "Modules" as these are the challenges from the Coursera course "Finding Hidden Messages in DNA". The purpose of uploading the scripts is for you to compare your answers or for any biologist with some coding background seeing actual code instead of the pseudocode provided in the material.
